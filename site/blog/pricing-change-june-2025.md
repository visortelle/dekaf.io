To help ensure the long-term sustainability of the project, we are making some important changes to our pricing model. These changes will take effect on **July 5, 2025**.

- Discontinuing free tier. **All free tier installations will stop working on the July 5, 2025**
- Price drop from **$249** per instance per month to **$129** per instance per month
- Price drop from **$2490** per instance per year to **$990** per instance per month

Thanks for using Dekaf! We are excited to continue building the best management tool for Apache Pulsar.
