# Connect to StreamNative Cloud

[StreamNative](https://streamnative.io) is a company founded by the original Apache Pulsar authors and provides managed Pulsar instances as a service.

It is the easy and affordable way to start use Apache Pulsar.

In this tutorial we'll:

- Create a new StreamNative Cloud account
  - Create a managed Apache Pulsar instance
- Install **Dekaf Desktop** and connect it to the created Pulsar instance.

:::warning

At the time of the latest article update, the minimal StreamNative Cloud managed Apache Pulsar instance monthly cost is about **75$**.

It means that if you'll finish this tutorial in 1 hour, you'll spend less than **1$** for StreamNative Cloud.

**In order to avoid unexpected spendings** don't forget to delete the created managed Apache Pulsar instance after finishing this tutorial.

Keep in mind that the network traffic and storage goes with additional price. It isn't relevant for this tutorial, but we think it's better to warn.
