# Local Pulsar Instances

> This feature is available on MacOS and Linux

Dekaf offers you an easy way to start an Apache Pulsar instance. This feature works out of the box. You don't need to install anything but **Dekaf Desktop**.

It's probably the most optimal way to start learning Pulsar without being overwhelmed with technical details from the beginning.
