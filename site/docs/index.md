# Overview

Dekaf is a tool for [Apache Pulsar](https://pulsar.apache.org/) that simplifies Pulsar visibility and operations.

Dekaf has two installation options - as a Docker container and as a desktop application.

The Docker container option is a multi-user application that is intended to be installed within your organization network boundaries.

The desktop application option is a single-user application that simplifies learning Pulsar. It's also suitable for small companies, teams that are building PoC project using Pulsar, or administrators in big companies who are responsible for managing multiple Pulsar instances.

Each installation option has free and paid editions. You can find more information at the [Licensing and Billing](./licensing-and-billing) page.
